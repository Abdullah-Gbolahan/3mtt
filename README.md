# 3MTT Program Portfolio

Welcome to my 3 Million Technical Talent (3MTT) Program portfolio! This repository serves as a collection of my work, projects, and learning journey throughout the 3MTT program.

## About 3MTT

The 3 Million Technical Talent (3MTT) program is a government-led initiative aimed at developing Nigeria's technical talent pipeline to strengthen the digital economy and position Nigeria as a net talent exporter. The program focuses on building technical skills in areas such as software development, cloud computing, and other in-demand tech skills.
